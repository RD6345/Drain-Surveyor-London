So, here is the static wordpress site that I'd mentioned. It needs to be bootstrapped, it's part of a range of sites that my client owns.

The original plan was to bootstrap it, then make the elements dynamic we're I can serve content from the back end.

I thought the design conforms to a grid layout quite nicely so might be a good practical thing to do if you fancy some basic bootstrap?
