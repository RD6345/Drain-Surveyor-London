Hi mate,

Sorry for the delay in contacting you, I'm juggling lots of bits of work at the moment. There is also a rising need for content management, in case you can suggest anyone.

So, here is the static wordpress site that I'd mentioned. The monstrosity that it is, and needs to be bootstrapped, it's part of a range of sites that my client owns.

http://www.drain-surveyor-london.co.uk

The original plan was to bootstrap it, then Zwetan will make the elements dynamic we're I can serve content from the back end.

It looks pap, but I thought the design conforms to a grid layout quite nicely so might be a good practical thing to do if you fancy some basic bootstrap?

I don't have access to the site but can teach you to use wget. :)

Claudio
